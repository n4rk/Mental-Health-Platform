# N7Therapy
N7 Therapy project is a psychological support platform, in which we present many services to support people with psychological difficulties.<br>
The web application offers a variety of services :<br>
     - The conversational agent, a chatbot with whom users can communicate and get answers to their questions and advices.<br>
     - Posts service to give our visitors the opportunity to view other people's experiences anonymously.<br>
     - Knowing that the solution to organize scattered ideas is perfect in writing, we have created the service of notepads which offers our users the possibility of organizing their thoughts and ideas and saving them safely.<br>
     - To facilitate access to contact parties who can help in the consultation of mental health, we have made available to our users a contact service called "Need Help".<br>
